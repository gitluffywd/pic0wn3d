# pic0wn3d
Raspberry Pi Pico W CircuitPython Remote Control based on [majdsassi's Pico WIFI Duck](https://github.com/majdsassi/Pico-WIFI-Duck).

# 💻 Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico W or Pico 2 W (H isn't really needed but AGGRO mode wont work with it)
- CircuitPython (with adafruit_hid, adafruit_httpserver)
- _keyboard_layout_win_fi.py_ & _keycode_win_fi.py_ included in the lib directory
- USB cable (hi-speed/data transfer)
- Target
- PC/Phone for remote control via the AP...

# 💥 Features
- Few ready made "scripts/payloads"
- This is setup for **Finnish language** (you need to figure out what your needs are yourself...)!
- Two modes: If jumper wire is on **GPIO15**, AGGRO mode is on (payload executed instantly) 
- LED behaviour based on status of connected clients
- Epic h4x layout for the web panel
- Responsive CSS so usage with phone is easy

# ✍️ Installing & Usage
- Get the .uf2 and libraries (adafruit_hid, adafruit_httpserver): [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/)
- Initialize the Pico by plugging it while pressing BOOTSEL button
- Drag & drop the CircuitPython .uf2 on the drive
- Name it **pic0wn3d** (only needed for the premade scripts for file grabbing)
- Drag & drop files on the root of the drive..
- Use jumper wire for **GPIO15** to "AGGRO mode" (load payload instantly when plugged in)
- Connect Pico W on the PC
- Use phone (or whatever) to connect to the AP (192.168.4.1)
- Have fun........

---------------------

If you uncomment boot.py (to hide the drive, you can't copy files to the device).
